Kinect-sports-game
==================
This project designs and implements a somatic sports imitation game based on the Microsoft motion sensing device Kinect. The whole process is conducted on the Ubuntu 12.04 platform with the help of Qt development environment as well as OpenNI, NiTE and OpenKinect development framework. The game is interesting and easy to play.

The thesis document illustrates the whole detail design and implementation process of this game system, including demand analysis and corresponding functional module design as well as the implementation and debug process. Finally, it summarizes the whole process and then briefly describes the development prospects of Kinect in the future.

After the game starts, it firstly demonstrates a set of actions and requests the players to imitate these actions to win current level. The game system judges whether the players win the game and enter into the next level. The implementation of the system is based on the previous function and structure design, consisting of vision module, action analysis module, player UI module and database module.

The characteristic of the thesis is that, it introduces the detail implementation process based on the source code and clearly shows the internal running principle of the game system.

For more detail about the implementation, please refer to the 'implementation and test report' and 'System document'.
